Before running any of the CTEMsoft programs, 
the user should create environmental variables named

CTEMsoft2013templates

and 

CTEMsoft2013resources

and set them to the full pathnames of the corresponding folders in the CTEMsoft2013 distribution.


For a c-shell (csh), this would be a line added to the user's .cshrc file

setenv CTEMsoft2013templates /Users/username/Path/to/the/following/folder/CTEMsoft2013/templatefolder
setenv CTEMsoft2013resources /Users/username/Path/to/the/following/folder/CTEMsoft2013/resources

Once this line has been added, type  "exec csh" to make the 
variable active.

For other shells, similar lines can be added to the appropriate setup file.
